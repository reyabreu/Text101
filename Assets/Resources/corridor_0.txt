You are standing in the prison corridor. The dirty, debris covered chequered tiles of the floor extend up to a flight of stairs ahead. A large locked closet is to your left, most probably used by the prison staff - currently nowhere to be seen. A clock on the wall shows the time. It is lunch break for prison guards, explaining why this section is unguarded.

Press S to walk up the Stairs, C to open the Closet doors or F to have a closer look at the Floor.
