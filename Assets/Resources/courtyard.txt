You reach the top of the stairs, to an open courtyard. A group of guards is walking steadily towards you returning from their break. With sweaty palms and lowering your sight, you attempt to pass unnoticed. Somebody on the side calls one of the guards by name and the group is momentarily distracted, allowing you to stroll by.

You give a quick side glance to this person and in the brief moment your eyes meet, an unmistakable sign of recognition and approval clears your doubts about the identity of your friend.

Press F to walk to freedom.
