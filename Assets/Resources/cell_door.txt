With the help of the mirror you pull out the key from its location and try it on the lock. It works! the door swings open and you inhale deeply the rush of fresh air coming in. There are no signs of prison guards and as you exhale with relief, your first thought is to reach the empty corridor.

You give thanks to the mysterious benefactor that put the key there.

Press W to walk to the corridor.
